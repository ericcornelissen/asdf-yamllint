# Contributing Guidelines

The maintainers of _asdf-yamllint_ welcome contributions and corrections. This
includes improvements to the documentation or code base, tests, bug fixes, and

small changes, such as fixing a typo, you can open a Pull Request directly.

If you decide to make a contribution, please use the following workflow:

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch from the latest `main`.
- Make your changes on the new branch.
- Commit to the new branch and push the commit(s).
- Open a Pull Request against `main`.
